## Description

As featured on [The Verge in 2021](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567127/water-resistance-tester-app-android-sealing), this app lets you test your phone's IP67/IP68 water resistance seals without dunking it in water. This will both help people have confidence in their phones' water resistance capabilities while also giving a way for people to hold manufacturers and repair shops accountable.

This app works by using the barometer built in to your phone. Do note that the seals can become compromised with drops and device aging - keep your phone away from all liquids!

[At least two of our community members](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/oev1rt/app_water_resistance_tester_app/h4clh6c/?context=3) have confirmed that this app's methodology is the same as the official methodology used by Samsung service technicians.

## Download the App

It was originally listed on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ray.waterresistancetester), but due to my disagreements with Google's Play Store policy changes, it is no longer available. Instead, you can download the app through the "Releases" page here.

## Helpful tips

These are some scenarios in which you may find this app particularly helpful.

### Scenario 1. Battery replacement needed

1. Run app, verify water resistance seals are intact

2. Send the phone off to a certified repair shop

3. Retrieve phone back from repair shop.

4. Re-run the test. Notice now that the water resistance seals are no longer intact. Now you can go back to the repair shop and get them to fix it. Or your money back.

In fact, you can do all of this, in person while at the shop, captured all on film.

### Scenario 2. You just purchased a used phone that was supposed to be water resistant.

1. Run the app.

2. If you find out the seals are intact, great. If you find out the seals are busted, now you know.

You could even use this as a pre-sale screening step - ask the seller to run the app on the phone they are selling, and have them film the process as proof - whether the water resistance seals are intact or not.

### Scenario 3. You just purchased a BRAND NEW phone that is supposed to be water resistant.

1. Run the app.

2. The test succeeds. Great, enjoy your new phone. Run the test every few weeks or so, to make sure your drops didn't impact the seal.

3. If the test fails, then you can return the phone within the return period, or send it for a warranty replacement in the warranty window.
